**A zen hyper-casual arrow puzzle game** with faith-based themes, where players tap directional vines to slide them off a grid in Snake-like movement. Body segments follow as a queue, and blocked vines animate back with spiritual messaging.

> _"God's grace is endless—try again!"_

## ✨ Features

- **🐍 Snake-Like Movement**: Vines slide in head direction with body segments following as queue
- **🙏 Grace System**: 3 Grace per level (4 for Transcendent) with faith-based messaging
- **📚 Module Structure**: 5 modules with 15 levels each, unlocking spiritual parables
- **🎨 Adaptive Themes**: Light/dark mode with watercolor zen garden aesthetics
- **🎯 Strategic Depth**: Dynamic blocking where clearing one vine unblocks others
- **📱 Cross-Platform**: iOS & Android support with 60 FPS performance
