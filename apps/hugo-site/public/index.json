This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, Parable Bloom.\nOur mission is to provide a peaceful, zen, and faith-based gaming experience. We believe that your digital peace of mind is just as important as your spiritual one. Therefore, we design our services to collect the absolute minimum amount of data necessary to function and improve the game.\n2.

This data is aggregated and anonymized, meaning it is not linked to your identity.\nThis information includes:\nUsage Data: Details about how you use the app, such as level completion rates, button taps, and session duration. This helps us balance difficulty and improve the user experience.

Crash \u0026amp; Performance Reports: Logs related to app crashes or performance issues to help us identify and fix bugs. 2.2 Future Data Services # As Parable Bloom evolves, we may introduce features that utilize cloud services (e.g., cloud saves or cross-device synchronization). If we do, we will update this policy to reflect any changes. Any such features will be opt-in, and we will continue to prioritize encryption and anonymity.\n3. How We Use Your Information # We use the collected anonymous data solely for the following purposes:\nTo operate and maintain the App: Ensuring the game runs smoothly on your device. To improve the App: Analyzing gameplay data to fix difficulty spikes, resolve bugs, and enhance performance.
