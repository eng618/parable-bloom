## Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** February 04, 2026

**Last Updated:** February 26, 2026

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to **Parable Bloom**. At **GVTech** ("we," "us," or "our"), we respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information you may provide to us. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application, **Parable Bloom**.

Our mission is to provide a peaceful, zen, and faith-based gaming experience. We believe that your digital peace of mind is just as important as your spiritual one. Therefore, we design our services to collect the absolute minimum amount of data necessary to function and improve the game.

## 2. Information We Collect

We prioritize your privacy and collect the minimum Personal Identifiable Information (PII) necessary. If you choose to create an account, we collect your email address; otherwise, data is collected anonymously.

### 2.1 Automatically Collected Information (Telemetry & Analytics)

To help us improve the game's stability and gameplay experience, we use third-party analytics tools (specifically **Google Firebase Analytics**) to automatically collect certain anonymous technical information. This data is **aggregated and anonymized**, meaning it is not linked to your identity.

This information includes:

- **Usage Data**: Details about how you use the app, such as level completion rates, button taps, and session duration. This helps us balance difficulty and improve the user experience.
- **Device Information**: Information about your device, such as the model, operating system version, and general location (country/region) derived from IP addresses (which are anonymized before storage).
- **Crash & Performance Reports**: Logs related to app crashes or performance issues to help us identify and fix bugs.

### 2.2 Account Information

If you choose to create an account, we collect:

- **Email Address & Password**: Used securely via Firebase Authentication to create and manage your account.
- **User ID**: A unique identifier generated by Firebase to track your game progress and save data across devices.

If you play anonymously, a temporary User ID is generated without collecting your email address.

## 3. How We Use Your Information

We use the collected data solely for the following purposes:

- **Account Management**: To create and secure your user account and save your game progress.
- **To operate and maintain the App**: Ensuring the game runs smoothly on your device.
- **To improve the App**: Analyzing gameplay data and crash logs to fix difficulty spikes, resolve bugs, and enhance performance.
- **To communicate**: If you contact us for support, we use your email address only to respond to your inquiries.

## 4. Third-Party Service Providers

We employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our App ("Service Providers"), to provide the App on our behalf, to perform Service-related services, or to assist us in analyzing how our App is used.

- **Google Firebase**: We use Firebase for analytics and crash reporting. Google may collect data as described in their privacy policy.

## 5. Children's Privacy

**Parable Bloom** does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under the age of 13. In the case we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us so that we will be able to do necessary actions.

## 6. Your Data Rights

Depending on your location, you may have rights regarding your data, including the right to request access to or deletion of data we hold about you.

You can delete your account and all associated data directly within the app by navigating to **Settings > Delete Account**. Alternatively, you may request account deletion at any time by visiting our [Account Deletion Page](https://parablebloom.com/account/delete).

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. These changes are effective immediately after they are posted on this page.
