## Deleting Your Parable Bloom Account

We respect your data privacy. If you wish to delete your Parable Bloom account and all associated data, you have two options depending on whether you currently have the app installed.

### Option 1: Delete via the App (Recommended)

The fastest and most secure way to delete your account is directly within the Parable Bloom app:

1. Open **Parable Bloom** on your device.
2. Navigate to the **Settings** screen (represented by the gear icon).
3. Find the Account Management section.
4. Select **Delete Account**.
5. Read the confirmation prompt and confirm your deletion.

Your account details will be permanently and immediately removed from our systems.

### Option 2: Request Deletion via Email (Web-based)

If you no longer have the app installed or cannot access it, you can submit a web-based request for account deletion via email.

Please send an email to our data deletion request address with the subject line "Account Deletion Request":

**Email:** <parablebloom.account+delete@garciaericn.com>

_Note: For security purposes, you must send this email from the same email address associated with your Parable Bloom account. We will process your request and permanently delete your data within 30 days._
