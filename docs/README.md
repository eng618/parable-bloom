# Parable Bloom – Master Documentation Index

## 🌿 Welcome to Parable Bloom

**Parable Bloom** is a **zen hyper-casual arrow puzzle game** with faith-based themes, where players tap directional vines to slide them off a grid in the direction of their head, mimicking Snake's movement. Body segments follow as a queue, and blocked vines animate back with spiritual messaging.

---

## 🎮 Core Gameplay

- **Snake-Like Movement**: Vines slide in head direction with body segments following as queue.
- **Grace System**: 3 Grace per level (4 for Transcendent), "God's grace is endless—try again!" messaging.
- **Module Structure**: 5 modules with 15 levels each, unlocking parables in the Journal.
- **Strategic Depth**: Blocking is dynamic—clearing one vine unblocks others.
- **Faith Integration**: Parables reveal spiritual reflections and scripture.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

- **Riverpod**: Reactive state management with providers for module progress, grace, vine states, and level data.
- **Hive**: Local persistence for module progression, grace system, and settings.
- **Flame**: 2D game engine with custom vine components and snake-like animations.
- **LevelSolver**: BFS-based solver ensuring all levels are solvable with directional path mechanics.
