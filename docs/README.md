# ParableWeave - Master Documentation Index

## 🌿 Welcome to ParableWeave

**ParableWeave** is a **zen hyper-casual arrow puzzle** where players clear a "garden" by untangling arrows to reveal parabolic blooms. It combines a minimalist aesthetic with deep strategic puzzle logic.

---

## 🎮 Core Gameplay

- **Zen Mechanics**: Tap arrows to clear paths. Move all arrows to "bloom" the level.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Subtle dots for the grid and clean line-segments for arrows reduce visual noise and improve clarity.
- **Lives System**: 3 hearts per level. Tapping a blocked arrow costs a life, adding a layer of thoughtful strategy.
- **Parable Integration**: Completing a level reveals a "parable bloom" with scripture and reflection.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture

- **Riverpod**: Reactive state management for logical integrity and complete decoupling from the UI.
- **Hive**: High-performance local persistence for progress, lives, and settings.
- **Flame**: Powerful 2D game engine ensuring smooth 60fps interactions on mobile.
- **LevelSolver**: Built-in BFS-based solver used for both real-time blocking calculation and automated level validation.
