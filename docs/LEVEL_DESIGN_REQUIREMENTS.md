# Parable Bloom - Level Design Requirements

This document outlines the formal requirements for designing levels in Parable Bloom, including module structure, level validation rules, difficulty scaling, and content organization.

## 🏗️ Module Structure

### Module Organization

Levels are organized into modules for content management and parable unlocks. Modules are **internal concepts only** - users see continuous level numbering.

```
assets/levels/
├── module_1/                # Tutorial Module (5 levels)
│   ├── module.json          # Tutorial metadata and welcome content
│   ├── level_1.json         # Global level 1 - Single vine, no blocking
│   ├── level_2.json         # Global level 2 - Two vines, no blocking
│   ├── level_3.json         # Global level 3 - Two vines with blocking
│   ├── level_4.json         # Global level 4 - Three vines with blocking
│   └── level_5.json         # Global level 5 - Simple puzzle
├── module_2/                # Mustard Seed Module (15 levels)
│   ├── module.json          # Parable content for reflection
│   ├── level_1.json         # Global level 6
│   ├── level_2.json         # Global level 7
│   └── ...                  # Up to level_15.json (global levels 8-20)
├── module_3/                # Sower Module (15 levels)
│   └── ...                  # Global levels 21-35
└── ...
```

### Module JSON Schema

Each module must have a `module.json` file:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "The Mustard Seed",
  "level_count": 15,
  "parable": {
    "title": "The Parable of the Mustard Seed",
    "scripture": "Matthew 13:31-32",
    "content": "He told them another parable: 'The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed, which a man took and planted in his field. Though it is the smallest of all seeds, yet when it grows, it is the largest of garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds come and perch in its branches.'",
    "reflection": "How does God use small beginnings to create great things in your life?",
    "background_image": "parable_mustard_seed.jpg"
  },
  "unlock_message": "Module complete! Take time to reflect on the parable."
}
```

### Visual Masking (for shaped grids)

Designers may want certain grid points to be visually hidden to create shapes (smileys, silhouettes) while keeping the underlying grid rectangular for movement and solver logic. To support this, levels may include an optional `mask` object with a `mode` and `points`:

- `mode`: `hide` (list points to hide), `show` (list points to render), or `show-all` (no mask). Default: `show-all`.
- `points`: array of either two-element arrays `[x,y]` or objects `{x: <int>, y: <int>}`.

Guidelines:

- Use `hide` when most points are visible and only a few are disguised (e.g., small eyes/mouth for a smiley).
- Use `show` when most points are hidden (sparse islands).
- Keep mask visual-only unless intentionally changing gameplay semantics; modifying solver/collision to exclude masked points requires explicit implementation work.

Example:

```json
"mask": { "mode": "hide", "points": [[2,2],[6,2],{"x":3,"y":4}] }
```

## 🎯 Level Structure

### Level JSON Schema

Each level file must include:

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "module_id": 1,
  "global_level_number": 1,
  "name": "First Steps",
  "grid_size": [9, 16],
  "difficulty": "Seedling",
  "vines": [
    {
      "id": "vine_1",
      "head_direction": "right",
      "ordered_path": [
        {"x": 0, "y": 0},
        {"x": 1, "y": 0},
        {"x": 2, "y": 0}
      ],
      "color": "moss_green"
    }
  ],
  "max_moves": 5,
  "min_moves": 3,
  "complexity": "low",
  "grace": 3
}
```

### Global Level Numbering

- `global_level_number` is what users see (continuous 1, 2, 3...)
- Computed as: `(module_id - 1) * levels_per_module + id`
- Internal `id` remains 1-15 within each module
- `module_id` identifies which module the level belongs to

## 📏 Difficulty Tiers & Validation Rules

### Difficulty Parameters

| Difficulty Tier | Grid Size | Total Cells | Vine Length (Avg) | Vine Count | Max Moves | Complexity | Grace |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------|-------------------|------------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **Seedling** | 5×8 to 9×16 | 40-144 | 6-8 | 18-24 | 5-8 | Low: Linear, no interlocks | 3 |
| **Nurturing** | 9×16 to 12×20 | 144-240 | 5-7 | 34-48 | 8-12 | Medium: 1-2 interlocks | 3 |
| **Flourishing** | 12×20 to 16×28 | 240-448 | 4-6 | 75-112 | 12-18 | High: Multi-interlocks | 3 |
| **Transcendent** | 16×28 to 24×40 | 448-960 | 3-5 | 192-320 | 18+ | Extreme: Deep cycles | 4 |

### Validation Rules

#### 1. Grid Occupancy (MANDATORY)

- **Minimum 95% of grid cells must be occupied by vines** at level start
- Calculation: `(total_vine_cells / total_grid_cells) ≥ 0.95`
- Ensures dense, strategic gameplay without empty space

#### 2. Vine Path Validation

- All vine paths must be contiguous (no gaps between segments)
- Only 90-degree turns allowed (up, down, left, right movement only)
- Head direction must match the first movement direction
- Minimum vine length: 2 segments (head + 1 body)

#### 3. Blocking Logic Validation

- No circular blocking dependencies between vines
- At least one vine must be clearable at level start (no deadlocks)
- Blocking relationships must reference valid vine IDs

#### 4. Difficulty-Specific Validation

- Vine count must be within the range for the difficulty tier
- Average vine length must match difficulty requirements
- Complexity level must match blocking depth requirements

#### 5. Solvability

- Level must be solvable using the LevelSolver BFS algorithm
- `min_moves` must be ≤ `max_moves`
- All vines must be clearable in sequence

## 🛠️ Content Creation Pipeline

### Adding a New Module

1. **Create Module Directory**: `assets/levels/module_X/`
2. **Create module.json**: Define parable content and metadata
3. **Create Level Files**: 15 level JSON files (level_1.json through level_15.json)
4. **Update pubspec.yaml**: Add new level assets
5. **Update Providers**: Adjust total level calculations if needed

### Level Design Process

1. **Choose Difficulty**: Select appropriate tier based on player progression
2. **Grid Setup**: Use specified grid size for the difficulty
3. **Vine Placement**: Place vines to achieve ≥95% occupancy
4. **Validation**: Run automated validation checks
5. **Testing**: Manual playtesting and solver verification
6. **Balance**: Adjust complexity to match difficulty parameters

### Automated Validation

Run validation on all levels:

```bash
flutter test test/level_validation_test.dart
```

Validation includes:

- JSON schema compliance
- Grid occupancy requirements
- Path continuity and blocking logic
- Difficulty parameter adherence
- Solvability verification

## 🎨 Visual & Audio Guidelines

### Vine Colors

- `moss_green`: Primary green for most vines
- `emerald`: Deeper green for contrast
- `olive`: Muted green for variety
- `sage`: Light green for accessibility

### Grid Aesthetics

- Subtle dot-based grid lines
- Adaptive colors for light/dark themes
- Smooth animations for vine movement and blocking

### Audio Cues

- Calm ambient wind sounds
- Soft chime for successful moves
- Gentle wilt sound for blocked attempts
- Celebratory bloom effect sounds

## 📊 Analytics & Balancing

### Key Metrics to Track

- Average moves per level vs. max_moves
- Level completion rates by difficulty
- Vine clearing success rates
- Player frustration points (blocked attempts)

### Balancing Guidelines

- **Seedling**: Tutorial-focused, forgiving difficulty
- **Nurturing**: Introduction of basic strategy
- **Flourishing**: Complex multi-step puzzles
- **Transcendent**: Expert-level challenges requiring deep planning

## 🔄 Future Expansion

### Planned Features

- **Shaped Grids**: Non-rectangular playing fields
- **Dynamic Elements**: Moving obstacles or changing vines
- **Time Pressure**: Optional timed challenges
- **Co-op Mode**: Multiplayer level variants

### Module Expansion

- Additional parable themes
- Seasonal content rotations
- Community-created level packs
- Progressive difficulty scaling beyond current tiers

## 🧪 Testing Requirements

### Unit Tests

- Vine blocking logic accuracy
- Level solver correctness
- JSON parsing validation
- Provider state management

### Integration Tests

- Complete level playthroughs
- Module progression logic
- Parable unlock mechanics
- UI state synchronization

### Performance Benchmarks

- Level loading times (<500ms)
- Animation smoothness (60 FPS)
- Memory usage for large grids
- Battery impact during extended play

## 📝 Quick Reference

### Grid Occupancy Formula

```
occupancy = (sum of all vine segment counts) / (grid_width × grid_height)
Required: occupancy ≥ 0.95
```

### Global Level Number

```
global_level = (module_id - 1) × 15 + level_id
```

### Vine Count Ranges

- **Seedling**: 18-24 vines
- **Nurturing**: 34-48 vines
- **Flourishing**: 75-112 vines
- **Transcendent**: 192-320 vines
